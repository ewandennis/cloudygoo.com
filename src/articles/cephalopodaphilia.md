I like tentacles.  They're dextrous, they have suckers and they move in the most deliciously creepy way.  I also have a long-running interest in something called 'procedural generation': using software and mathematics together to produce visuals.  I recently built some procedurally-generated tentacles as a sort of visual experiment.

>Tell me, O Octopus, I begs,<br/>
Is those things arms, or is they legs?
I marvel at thee, Octopus
If I were thou, I'd call me Us.
 - Ogden Nash
